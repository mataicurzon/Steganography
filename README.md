This is a library of functions and methods that can be called from a testing class to detect and extract images, strings, and any other data from unknown/unfamiliar png files. It is designed to defeat the steganographic strategy of hiding information in specific bits of the color channels of the png file (LSB based image steganography). You can use these libraries to get information encoded in any combination of bits of any combination of color channels in any order.

This is intended to be used as a tool to find and pull messages from unknown and unfamiliar png files.
